# Dropzie

**[See a demo](https://jeremyblaze.github.io/Dropzie/)**

A simple, searchable jQuery dropdown select menu that behaves how you'd expect...

- It runs automatically based on a native select menu
- If you update the select menu, the Dropzie menu reinitialises
- When the Dropzie menu is changed, the native select menu is changed (meaning form submissions work automatically)

_See index.html for demos and example usage._

### To do...

- [ ] Change event not firing
- [ ] Callback
- [ ] Focus menu with tab key
- [ ] Validation
- [ ] Field style (have an option to make it look like a field with a dropdown instead of a menu)
- [ ] Need a way to destroy the menu
- [ ] Option groups
